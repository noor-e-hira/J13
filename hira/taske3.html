<p align=""justify">Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of Indian subcontinent.[1][2][3] It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan.[4] It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or potatoes in certain regional varieties.[5] The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, birian, which means 'fried before cooking'. It is a popular dish that has acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine
