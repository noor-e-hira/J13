	<h2>Q: What is protocol?</h2>
	<p>A Protocol is a set of rules that we use for specific purposes. In the current
scenario, when we are talking about protocols, it is about communication- the way
we talk to each other. For instance, a newsreader speaks in English and because
you understand English, you are able to understand. English is the protocol.
Now, talking about the web, in particular, multiple protocols are used to
communicate. Primarily for end users, the most important and visible protocols
are HTTP and HTTPS. Though there are many other protocols as well, HTTP and
HTTPS protocols cater to most of the population.</p>
<h2>What is http?</h2>
<pre>HTTP means Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying
protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are
formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take
in response to various commands</pre>
<h2>What is https?</h2><p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP,
the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you
are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all
communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is
often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking
and online shopping order forms.</p>
<h2>Encryption and Encryption Levels:</h2>
<p>Encryption is simple terms is a hiding information. There are various ways to do
so. You must have heard these terms - 128 bit encrypt HTTPS and 64 bit encrypt
HTTPS. 128-bit Encrypt is a high encryption technique and it's very difficult to
decrypt (decode). In the case of HTTPS when the data is being transferred on the
wires, the man in the middle may still know what is being transferred, but cannot
make sense out of it as the data is encrypted. Only the browser will decrypt it and
show it, and the server will decrypt it and use it for transactions.</p>

<h2>IP addressing:</h2>
<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol
suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function
enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.
IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on
the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures
that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label
the datagram with source and destination information.
</p>
<h2>Functions:</h2><p>The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into
datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host
interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.
[1] For these purposes, the
Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.
Each datagram has two components: a header and a payload. The IP header includes source IP
address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram.
The payload is the data that is transported. This method of nesting the data payload in a packet
with a header is called encapsulation.
IP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces.
The address space is divided into sub networks, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP
routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets 
across network boundaries. Routers communicate with one another via specially
designed routing protocols, either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols, as
needed for the topology of the network.<img src="http 3.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></p><h2>Static IP addressing:</h2><p>A static Internet Protocol (IP) address (static IP address) is a permanent number assigned to a
computer by an Internet service provider (ISP). Static IP addresses are useful for gaming,
website hosting or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.
</p><h2>Dynamic IP:</h2><p>A dynamic Internet Protocol address (dynamic IP address) is a temporary IP address that is
assigned to a computing device or node when it's connected to a network. A dynamic IP address
is an automatically configured IP address assigned by a DHCP server to every new network
node.</p><h2>MAC ADDRESS:</h2><p>A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique identifier assigned to
a network interface controller (NIC). For communications within a network segment, it is used as
a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi,
and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, MAC addresses are used
in the medium access control protocol sub layer of the data link layer. As typically represented,
MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens,
colons, or no separator (see Notational conventions below).
A MAC address may be referred to as the burned-in address, and is also known as an Ethernet
hardware address, hardware address, and physical address (not to be confused with
a memory physical address).
A network node with multiple NICs must have a unique MAC address for each.
Sophisticated network equipment such as a multilayer switch or router may require one or more
permanently assigned MAC addresses.
MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of network interface cards. Each is
stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or by a firmware mechanism. A MAC
address typically includes the manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC
addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on Extended
Unique Identifiers (EUI) managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE): EUI-48, which replaces the obsolete term MAC-48,
[1] and EUI-64.<img src="http 4.jpg"></p><h2>Domain name:</h2><p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or
control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for applicationspecific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it
represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a 
server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the
Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.
[1]
Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name
registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains)
of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level
domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent
domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these toplevel domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically
open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other
publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.
The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their
services to the public.
</p><h2>Domain name space</h2><p>Today, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages the toplevel development and architecture of the Internet domain name space. It authorizes domain name
registrars, through which domain names may be registered and reassigned. The domain name space
consists of a tree of domain names. Each node in the tree holds information associated with the domain
name. The tree sub-divides into zones beginning at the DNS root zone.<img src="http 5.jpg"></p>
<h2>URL</h2><p>A uniform resource locator (URL) is the address of a resource on the Internet. A URL indicates
the location of a resource as well as the protocol used to access it.
A URL contains the following information:
<ul><li>The protocol used to a access the resource
<li>The the location of the server (whether by IP address or domain name)</li> 
 </li><li>The port number on the server (optional)
 </li><li>The location of the resource in the directory structure of the server
</li><li> A fragment identifier (optional)</li></ul>
Also known as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or Web address. A URL is a type of
uniform resource identifier (URI). In common practice, the term URI isn't used, or is used
synonymously with URL, even though this is technically incorrect.</p><h2>Host:</h2><p>A host (also known as "network host") is a computer or other device that communicates with
other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers -- that send or receive
data, services or applications</p>
