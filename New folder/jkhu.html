	<p>The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into
datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host
interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.
<b>For these purposes, the
Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.
Each datagram has two components: a header and a payload.</b><hr> <strong style="color: red">The IP header includes source IP
address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram.</strong> The IP header includes source IP

routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets 
across network boundaries. Routers communicate with one another via specially
designed routing protocols, either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols, as
needed for the topology of the netwo.</p>
